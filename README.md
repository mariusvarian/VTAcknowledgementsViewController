## How to Install

CocoaPods is the most common solution to install this library.

1. Add `pod 'VTAcknowledgementsViewController'` to your `Podfile`.
2. Run `pod install`.
3. Add the `Pods-#target#-acknowledgements.plist` file generated by CocoaPods in `Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-#target#/` to your main target (drag and drop the file in your Xcode project). Don’t copy the file, leave `Copy items if needed` unchecked.

## Initialization

The `VTAcknowledgementsViewController` instance is usually pushed to an existing `UINavigationController`.

``` objc
VTAcknowledgementsViewController *viewController = [VTAcknowledgementsViewController acknowledgementsViewController];
[self.navigationController pushViewController:viewController animated:YES];
```

By default, the controller will try to guess the name of your `.plist` file, based on the bundle name (`Pods-#bundle-name#-acknowledgements.plist`). If that doesn’t match the file you’re looking for, you can initialize the view controller with a custom file name or path.

``` objc
viewController = [[VTAcknowledgementsViewController alloc] initWithFileNamed:@"Pods-MyTarget-acknowledgements"];
```

``` objc
NSString *path = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"Pods-MyTarget-acknowledgements" ofType:@"plist"];
viewController = [[VTAcknowledgementsViewController alloc] initWithPath:path];
```

If you want to include licenses that are not part of a `plist` file, you can easily create new `VTAcknowledgement` instances, and use them for the acknowledgements array of the controller.

``` objc
VTAcknowledgement *customLicense = [[VTAcknowledgement alloc] initWithTitle:@"..." text:@"..." license:nil];
viewController = [[VTAcknowledgementsViewController alloc] initWithAcknowledgements:@[customLicense]];
```

## Customization

The controller can also display a header and a footer. By default, they are loaded from the generated `plist` file, but you can also directly change the properties values. If these texts contain a link, the view is tappable, and opens a browser with the URL.

``` objc
viewController.headerText = @"We love open source software.";
viewController.footerText = @"Powered by CocoaPods.org";
```

The controller title is a localized value for “acknowledgements”. You might want to use this localized value for the button presenting the controller.

``` objc
NSString *localizedTitle = [VTLocalization localizedTitle]; 
[button setTitle:localizedTitle forState:UIControlStateNormal];
```

By default, the `VTAcknowledgementsViewController` uses the “grouped” table view style. You can choose a different style:

``` objc
viewController = [[VTAcknowledgementsViewController alloc] initWithAcknowledgements:@[] style:UITableViewStylePlain];
```

If you need to further customize the appearance or behavior of this pod, feel free to subclass its classes.

## Apple TV

VTAcknowledgementsViewController is also compatible with tvOS for Apple TV apps.
